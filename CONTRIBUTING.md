Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine. [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) is a great one to get you inspired.

### Report bugs

Report bugs and issues by submitting a [bug report](../../issues/new?labels=type%3A+bug&template=bug_report.md). Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

### Feature Requests and Support

If you have an idea of how to improve this project (or anything related, really) or have general feedback, you're welcome to submit a [feature request](../../issues/new?labels=type%3A+feature+request&template=feature_request.md).

Chances are, you like what we have already but you may require a custom integration, a special license or something else big and specific to your needs that our community may not benefit from. We're generally open to such conversations.

If you have a question and can't find the answer yourself, you can [raise an issue](../../issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=support-request.md&title=I+have+a+question+about+%3Cthis+and+that%3E+%5BSupport%5D) and describe what exactly you're trying to do. We'll do our best to reply in a meaningful time.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

At this very moment, we're working on the CLA. Until it is ready we may be on the slower side in accepting your contributions.
